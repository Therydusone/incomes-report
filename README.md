# Incomes Report

This is project I've made for one of the companies I applied to. Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish task yet so it is in progress...

## Getting Started

To get project on your machine use

```
git clone https://github.com/Therydusone/incomes-report.git
```



## Prerequisites

For project running nice and smoothly you need

```
node.js v12.16.1
```

```
yarn -v 1.19.1
```

## Installing

To start the project use 

```
yarn start
```

## Built With
```
react-table
```
```
styled-components
```
```
Hooks
```

## What's done and what need's to be done
- [x] Table with company names and cities
- [x] Search box filtering whole content
- [x] Added sorting
- [x] Added pagination
#### TO DO
- [ ] Fetch incomes and display them in table

## Problems
Unfortunately I wasn't able to get into data fetched from incomes and display values. No matter what I tried I got empty array and couldn't get into values of incomes.
This is propably due to condition race somewhere during fetching and needs to be remade for example with Hooks.
